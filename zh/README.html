<h1>README<br/><span id="version">Version 1.0, March 2008</span></h1>

<p>This document describes the reconstructed <strong>Chinese etymology
of Lojban</strong>, which is available in the original <a
href="lojban-source-words_zh.txt">plain text format</a> and in <a
href="index.html">HTML format</a>, generated by a <a
href="htmlize.py">conversion script</a>. In some cases, the
reconstructed Chinese source word is dubious or missing; these cases
are marked by a comment with the string
<em>&ldquo;FIXIT&rdquo;</em></p>

<h2 id="copying">Copying conditions</h2>

<p>The &ldquo;Chinese etymology of Lojban&rdquo; in <a
href="lojban-source-words_zh.txt">plain text</a> and in <a
href="index.html">HTML format</a> as well as the <a
href="htmlize.py">conversion script</a> were prepared by <a
href="mailto:mublin@dealloc.org">mublin</a> in March 2008. The content
of these three files is hereby placed irrevocably in the public
domain.</p>

<p>Unless specified otherwise, English translations of Chinese source
words are from the <a
href="http://www.mandarintools.com/cedict">CEDICT dictionary</a>,
which is in the <a href="http://www.mandarintools.com/cedict">public
domain</a>. The <a
href="http://www.lojban.org/publications/wordlists/gismu.txt">official
gismu list</a>, prepared by The Logical Language Group, Inc., is in
the <a
href="http://www.lojban.org/publications/wordlists/public_domain.txt">
public domain</a>.</p>

<hr/>
<h2 id="formathtml">Format of the HTML version</h2>

<p>In the generated HTML version, each gismu is given in bold,
followed by the English keyword and the Lojbanised source word on one
line.</p>

<p>On the next line, the reconstructed Chinese source word is given in
traditional script, simplified script, pinyin transcription, and
English translation.</p>

<p>If present, a comment starts on a new line in smaller font.</p>

<hr/>
<h2 id="format">Format of the plain text version</h2>

<p>The plain text file is encoded in UTF-8 with UNIX style line
breaks. Each gismu has one line with TAB-separated fields, in the
following format:</p>

<ol id="fields">
<li>gismu</li>
<li>English keyword</li>
<li>Chinese source word in Lojbanised form</li>
<li>Chinese source word in traditional script</li>
<li>Chinese source word in simplified script (optional)</li>
<li>pinyin transcription</li>
<li>English translation</li>
<li>comment (optional)</li>
</ol>

<p>A small number of gismu have two Lojbanised forms; each of these
forms gets its own line. These gismu are &ldquo;torni, mamta, lenjo,
dansu, detri, datka, xalni, minra, and kantu.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The etymology does not include the cultural gismu, the gismu
&ldquo;broda, brode, brodi, brodo, brodu&rdquo; which have been
constructed from &ldquo;bridi&rdquo;, &ldquo;donri&rdquo; which seems
to have been constructed from &ldquo;dinri&rdquo;, and other gismu
which have not been generated from the six source languages.</p>

<p>The following conventions are used inside the comment field:</p>

<dl>
<dt>FIXIT ...</dt>
<dd>needs review for the given reason</dd>

<dt>FIXIT missing</dt>
<dd>the source word could not be reconstructed</dd>

<dt>FIXIT dubious</dt>
<dd>the source word could be reconstructed, but may be wrong</dd>

<dt>FIXIT correct transcription &ldquo;...&rdquo;</dt>
<dd>the source word does not exactly match the Lojbanised form; the
correct Lojbanisation for the source word is specified (tagged as
FIXIT because this may also be due to wrong reconstruction)</dd>

<dt>cf. ... (...) [...] &ldquo;...&rdquo;</dt>
<dd>Chinese word with simplified form, pinyin, and translation</dd>

<dt>cf. ... (...) [...] &ldquo;...&rdquo; (compound)</dt>
<dd>Chinese compound word including the source word</dd>

<dt>cf. ... (...) [...] &ldquo;...&rdquo; (component)</dt>
<dd>Chinese word included in the compound source word</dd>

<dt>cf. ... (...) [...] &ldquo;...&rdquo; (variant)</dt>
<dd>another source word candidate, less frequently used or with a meaning more distant from the gismu definition</dd>

<dt>source: ...</dt>
<dd>main translation from an authority other than CEDICT</dd>

<dt>&ldquo;...&rdquo; (source: ...)</dt>
<dd>additional translation from an authority other than CEDICT</dd>
</dl>

<p>Translations from chinaboard.de are given in the original German; an
English translation is given in parentheses: &ldquo;GERMAN-1; GERMAN-2;
... (= ENGLISH-1; ENGLISH-2; ...)&rdquo;</p>

<p>Compound words are indicated where the source word has too broad or
distant a meaning when taken on its own, but as a component in the
compound words clearly matches the gismu.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;component&rdquo; category is also used where both the
source word and the additional Chinese word have a common
component.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;variant&rdquo; category includes mere character variants
having identical pronunciation and meaning, distinct words matching
the same Lojbanised source word possibly with minor differences in
pronunciation and meaning, as well as variant pronunciations of the
same character matching the same Lojbanised source word.</p>

<hr/>
<h2 id="procedure">Reconstruction procedure</h2>

<p>The list of gismu with English keyword and the Chinese source words
in Lojbanised form was obtained from the <a
href="http://www.lojban.org/tiki/tiki-index.php?page=gismu%20Etymology">gismu
etymology file</a>. This file lists source language words in a
Lojbanised form, in ASCII, without inflectional endings and with
affricates reduced to simple spirants; and a few other rules, some of
them source-language specific.</p>

<p>Each English keyword was first looked up in the <a
href="http://www.mandarintools.com/cedict.html">CEDICT dictionary</a>
at <a href="http://www.mandarintools.com">mandarintools.com</a>.  This
produced between zero and about twenty Chinese candidate words for
each Lojbanised source word. Each Chinese word was given in
traditional script, simplified script, pinyin transcription, and
English translation.</p>

<p>Each of the candidates was checked manually, matching the
Lojbanised source word against the pinyin transcription, and the
English translation of the Chinese candidate against the English
keyword for the gismu as well as the <a
href="http://www.lojban.org/publications/wordlists/gismu.txt">official
gismu definition</a>.</p>

<p>Where no matches could be found, or the match was dubious, the
additional dictionaries at <a
href="http://www.zhongwen.com">zhongwen.com</a>, <a
href="http://www.chinaboard.de">chinaboard.de</a> and <a
href="http://en.wiktionary.org">en.wiktionary.org</a> were
consulted. Where multiple matches remained, one of these was chosen
both by semantical closeness to the gismu definition and by frequency
of use as indicated by a <a href="http://www.google.com">web search
engine</a>; the eliminated match was reported in the comment
field.</p>

<hr/>
<h2 id="sources">Etymological sources</h2>

<p>The most important etymological source for Lojban is the <a
href="http://www.lojban.org/tiki/tiki-index.php?page=gismu%20Etymology">list
of gismu with Lojbanised source words and scores</a>. The format of
this file is described in detail in <a
href="http://www.lojban.org/lists/lojban-list/msg29672.html">this
message</a> to the Lojban mailing list and the file <a
href="http://www.lojban.org/publications/etymology/etysample.txt">etysample.txt</a>
on the Lojban server. Additional information can be found at the <a
href="http://www.lojban.org/tiki/tiki-index.php?page=Lojban+Etymology&bl">Lojban
Etymology</a> wiki page, on the <a
href="http://www.lojban.org/files/roadmap.html#etymology">Lojban file
server</a> and in <a
href="http://www.lojban.org/publications/etymology/">this
directory</a> on the Lojban server.</p>

<p>The gismu generation process is described in more detail in <a
href="http://lojban.org/publications/level0/brochure/lingissues.html#AEN12599">&ldquo;What
is Lojban?&rdquo;, ch. 4, sec. 17</a>, and in the <a
href="http://www.lojban.org/tiki/tiki-download_wiki_attachment.php?attId=194&page=The+Lojban+Reference+Grammar#s14">&ldquo;Reference
Grammar&rdquo;, ch. 4, sec. 14</a>.</p>

<p>The following gismu are missing in the gismu etymology file:
&ldquo;gocti&rdquo; (yocto), &ldquo;gotro&rdquo; (yotta),
&ldquo;zepti&rdquo; (zepto), &ldquo;zetro&rdquo; (zetta),
&ldquo;slovo&rdquo; (Slavic), and &ldquo;vukro&rdquo; (Ukrainian). The
cultural gismu &ldquo;mexno&rdquo; is listed as &ldquo;mexco&rdquo; in
the gismu etymology file. None of these gismu were generated from the
six source languages, so this does not affect the Chinese
etymology. The gismu &ldquo;ckamu&rdquo; was changed to
&ldquo;mleca&rdquo; with unchanged source words, it is given only in
the newer form here.</p>

<p>The correspondence between Lojban gismu and TLI Loglan, which is
also of etymological interest, is described in detail in the file <a
href="http://www.lojban.org/files/wordlists/oldlog">oldlog.txt</a> on
the Lojban server.</p>
